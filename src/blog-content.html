                    We've come so far I hope you tried to solve the previous questions I have given to you. Now it's
                    time to move further.

                    In this tutorial, we will learn about what is ADT and the concept of ARRAYs ADT.

                    ADT - Abstract Datatypes.

                    what is ADT or Abstract Datatype?

                    In simple words, Abstract datatype is the mathematical model of data structures that specifies the
                    type of data stores, and the operations supported on them.

                    There are some examples of ADTs like - Arrays, Lists, queues, Sets, Stacks, Tables, Trees, Vectors,
                    etc.

                    You might have seen them in your programming career. Arrays and List are very common terms in
                    programming.

                    Now you know what is meant by abstract datatypes. But with abstract datatypes, you can see one more
                    term i.e Arrays. What is an array?

                    An array is a type of data structure that stores the data in contiguous memory locations, and every
                    element of an array can be accessed using its index number, index number of an array starts with 0
                    to n.




                    As you can see in the above image. Elements of an array stored in contiguous memory locations, you
                    can also see indexes and a total number of elements in the image.
                    After knowing what is array it is important to know the limitations of an array. An array is of
                    fixed size, which means the size of an array never changes once it is created, even if we desire to
                    change it.
                    To understand this, assume we have an array of storing capacity of 5 elements, we already filled our
                    array with 5 elements, now we are trying to push the 6th element inside an array, but since the size
                    of an array is fixed, the 6th element never goes into an array.




                    If still want to add extra items to your array then you need to create one bigger array and then
                    copy all the elements of an existing array to it.



                    If you're familiar with any kind of programming language, then you know there are some operations we
                    can do with arrays.
                    like-
                    get(element) -> get element from array using its index.
                    set(index, value) -> set value at specific index.
                    In some other programming languages, there are more operations like -
                    max()
                    min()
                    Search(element)
                    Append(element)
                    Resize()
                    etc...
                    do not confuse it with resize(), Resize means copying all elements of an existing array to a bigger
                    array.

                    There are two types of an array -
                    1) Static array - size cannot be changed.
                    2) Dynamic array - size can be changed.

                    Now you're thinking how dynamic size can be altered if the size of an array is fixed. This is
                    because a Dynamic array allocates memory during runtime using Heap memory. which means a Dynamic
                    array creates a bigger and copies all the elements of an existing array to that bigger array during
                    runtime. yes, I know this is awesome. But this also has its drawbacks we will discuss further.

                    So that is it for today guys, now it's time to say goodbye, if you appreciate my work then please
                    let your friends know about this course. If you are new to this course kindly check out previous
                    tutorials, which will give you lots of new things about DSA.
                    In the next chapter, we will discuss the implementation of an array, and how to allocate the array
                    in heap memory, in the next chapter finally we play with code, we will code in c programming as I
                    said earlier, you can code in your desire language.
                    See ya in the next tut, take care and good bye.
